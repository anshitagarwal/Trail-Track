The Hague:                     Far-right politician Geert Wilders was Monday named by a television poll as Dutch politician of the year as his Freedom Party gains ground amid a polarising debate on Europe's migrant crisis.
Wilders won 25 percent of the 37,000 votes cast, and became the first politician to win the annual award three times from the Een Vandaag (one Today) programme, broadcast on the public broadcaster Netherlands 1.
The news came as Dutch officials revealed the country will this year break all records for the number of migrants seeking asylum in The Netherlands.
So far by mid-November, some 54,000 people had requested asylum in the country -- surpassing the last record of 52,500 requests made in 1994 at the height of the Balkans conflict.
Opinion polls show that Wilders's party, the anti-immigrant PVV, is on track to win more than 35 seats in the 150-seat Lower House if elections -- not due to be held until 2017 -- were to be held today.
Europe is grappling with its worse migrant crisis since World War II, and Wilder's message that he would close the country's borders is gaining traction with some Dutch voters.

Dutch far-right Freedom Party leader Geert Wilders: his comments led to a record 6,400 complaints to the police.
Dutch right-wing politician Geert Wilders has been given a date of March 18th for his second trial for inciting racism and hatred – at a time when his party is topping opinion polls as a result of widespread anger over immigration from Iraq and Syria.
In June 2011, Mr Wilders was found not guilty of inciting hatred against Muslims when he compared the Koran to Hitler’s Mein Kampf and described Islam as a fascist religion, comments the judges found were “within the bounds of legitimate political debate”.
His comments led to a record 6,400 complaints to the police, a series of high-profile resignations from his Freedom Party and are widely believed to have prompted a backlash that damaged his chances of a much stronger showing in the European elections the following May.
At the time, the Freedom Party leader refused to withdraw the comments and said he would not allow himself to be silenced because he did want “fewer Moroccans and less Islam in the Netherlands”.
Mr Wilders was questioned under caution by police on December 8th last year.
Afterwards, the public prosecutor’s office issued a short statement: “Politicians can go a long way in what they say and remain protected by the right to free speech.
The opening of the case on March 18th is expected to be largely procedural, focusing on the background to the charges and setting dates for witnesses, an issue which has already been controversial.
Mr Wilders meanwhile was voted Politician of the Year last week by a Dutch TV current affairs programme.

The Party for Freedom leader has come under steady fire from leftist politicans and the mainstream media this past week since a riot in the Dutch town of Geldermalsen over the establishment of refugee camps near a number of Dutch towns.
Incredible footage shot at the time showed the protesters pushing back police lines and tearing up fences as they approached the town hall.
A meeting of the town council over the decision to locate a migrant camp had to be abandoned halfway through an address given by a hijab-wearing speaker as the protesters reached the plate glass walls of the hall.
Responding to those who have criticised his silence over the riot, and the perceived influence he may have had over it in urging individuals to “resist” the camp, Mr.
In addition to the riot last week, a Somali migrant family has also been attacked in the Netherlands in the past week, with the finger of blame again being pointed at the politician.
Fireworks were fired at the home of the family, and a leaflet left behind bearing the words “foreigners must go, this is just the beginning” and a picture of Mr.
Geert Wilders is a veteran campaigner in Europe and has used his time as member of the Dutch and European parliaments to speak out about the dangers of the Islamification of Europe.

Wilders has previously issued statements rejecting the violence at protests about plans to locate refugee centres in several Dutch towns.
Before the meeting, Wilders had urged people to ‘resist’ the establishment of a refugee centre in the town of 15,000.
‘Wilders has ignored the opportunity to condemn the violence in Geldermalsen,’ deputy prime minister Lodewijk Asscher said.
He described the PVV leader, recently voted politician of the year by viewers of television programme EenVandaag, as a ‘trader in fear’.
Later in the week, fireworks were hurled at the home of a Somali family in Pannerden, south east of Arnhem.

The trial of PVV leader Geert Wilders on charges of inciting racism and hatred will start on March 18 with a procedural hearing, The Hague’s district court said on Friday.
The hearing will focus on the investigation into the charges against Wilders and set dates for witness appearances and the rest of the trial.
Wilders faces prosecution for his comments about Moroccan nationals on March 12 and 19, 2015, during and after the local election campaign.
The comments led to over 6,400 complaints to the police and a slew of resignations from the PVV.
OffenceThe public prosecution department says that while it considers Wilders has insulted people on racial grounds and encouraged discrimination and hatred, this does not mean he has committed a criminal offence.
In June 2011, Wilders was found not guilty of charges of inciting hatred and discrimination against Muslims and non-westerm immigrants by judges in Amsterdam.
The court ruled that some of Wilders’ statements were insulting, shocking and on the edge of legal acceptibility, but that they were made in the broad context of a political and social debate on the multi-cultural society.

On Thursday PVV leader Geert Wilders posted a picture of a grandstand full of people in white robes on Twitter.
“This is the Moroccan parliament”, he wrote.
According to RTL Nieuws, Wilders’ tweet was in response to a tweet from PVV parliamentarian Machiel de Graaf.
De Graaf commented on PvdA MP Khadija Arib’s candidacy for Tweede Kamer president.
“Someone who is subordinate to the king of Morocco must not be president of the Dutch Tweede Kamer”, De Graaf tweeted.
Hundreds of people decided this was a good time to show the PVV leader what other things are.
“This is a pug”, “this is another pug”, “this is a black pug”, “this is a screenshot of your tweet”, “this is a chair in South Africa”, “this is my desk”, “this is my father’s day gift’, “this is the naked but of Justin Bieber” and “this is a beer with dentures in it”, is just some of the many responses.

We need brave leaders”, he tweeted on the 7th of December, the day Trump announced the policy.
He also re-Tweeted Trump’s announcement; “Just put out a very important policy statement on the extraordinary influx of hatred & danger coming into our country.
He has spoken at PEGIDA rallies in Germany, at the ‘Draw Mohammed’ competition which was attacked by Jihadists in the US, and most recently in Australia.
He told AFP at the time: “I’m not asking for anything strange, I am asking that our government close its doors as Hungary did … that we close our borders to those we consider to be migrants, not refugees.
 Polls revealed that if an election was held just after the comments were made in November, his young PVV party would win 38 seats in the 150-seat Lower House, its largest-ever showing in a predictive survey.

Dutch right-wing politician Geert Wilders, who said it would be good for Europe and America if Donald Trump became the next US president.
Dutch right-wing politician Geert Wilders has said he hopes Donald Trump will become the next president of the United States – because it would be “good for America and good for Europe”.
Mr Wilders backed the controversial Republican candidate in a post to his Twitter account, @geertwilderspvv, late on Monday evening – around the same time Mr Trump issued his controversial statement suggesting that Muslims should be banned from entering the US.
In the tweet, which included an image of the Stars and Stripes, Mr Wilders – who is to face trial next year for allegedly “inciting discrimination and hatred” against Moroccans living in the Netherlands – added: “We need brave leaders.
Mr Trump and Mr Wilders now have in common that each of them has called for the closure of his country’s borders to Muslims – claiming that to do otherwise would be to leave them vulnerable to attack by Islamist extremists.
Responding in September to a plan by European Commission president, Jean-Claude Juncker to distribute refugees from Iraq and Syria among EU states, Mr Wilders described the migrant influx as “an Islamic invasion” that threatened Europe’s “prosperity, security, and identity”.
Earlier on Monday, Dutch prime minister Mark Rutte responded to a video posted on YouTube in which Mr Wilders addressed Turkish president Recep Tayyip Erdogan and told him Turkey should “forget about” joining the EU.
Largely as a result of opposition to the 9,000-plus refugees allocated to the Netherlands under the Juncker scheme, opinion polls are putting Mr Wilders’s Freedom Party ahead of Mr Rutte’s Liberals – giving them 26 per cent of the vote.
This would make the Freedom Party the largest in the Netherlands if an election were held, with 39 out of 150 seats in parliament – putting Mr Wilders in a strong position to form a coalition government.
Marjolein Faber, leader of the Freedom Party in the Senate, commented: “Most of those cooking would be men with other values who would be able to walk through the nursing home where female staff members are often alone at night.
